# (Beta) Sending Data to Adobe Analytics

>[!IMPORTANT]

>Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK is currently in beta and is not available to all users. The documentation and the functionality are subject to change.

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK can send data to Adobe Analytics. This works by translating `xdm` into a format the Adobe Analytics can use.

## Setup

Adobe Analytics automatically picks up the data you are sending if you have a report suite mapped in the Customer Config UI. Here you can map one or more reportings to a given config. After a report suite is mapped, the data will automatically begin flowing.

## Automatically Mapped Data

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network automatically maps many XDM variables automatically. The complete list of automatically mapped variables is listed [here](../analytics/automatically-mapped-vars.md).

## Manually Mapped Data

All data collected by the edge network can be accessed via processing rules. The data is flattened using dot notation and available as contextData.

If you had a schema that looked like this.

```javascript
{
  key:value,
  object:{
    key1:value1,
    key2:value2
  },
  array:[
    v0,
    v1,
    v2
  ],
  arrayofobjects:[
    {
      obj1key:objval0
    },
    {
      obj2key:objval1
    }
  ]
}
```

Then these would be the context data keys available to you.

```javascript
a.x.key //value
a.x.object.key1 //value1
a.x.object.key2 //value2
a.x.array.0 //v0
a.x.array.1 //v1
a.x.array.2 //v2
a.x.arrayofobjects.0.obj1key //objval0
a.x.arrayofobjects.1.obj2key //objval1
```

Here is an example of a processing rule that would use this data.
